    <h3>Hello, welcome to <strong>BUDGET WITH ME!</strong></h3><br>
    <h3>This is your new personal budget app. To get started, simply click on "Add Event" in your Dashboard
    and enter your recurring/irregular income and/or bills. Our app will provide a snapshot of your current balance (for 7, 15 or 30 days)
    based on the amount of savings and debt you have.</h3><br>
    <h3>If you have a family member or spouse that you would like to invite to your budget account,
    go to "Users Management" and enter their information. They will receive a notification to join your account, and they
    will be able to insert their budget and expenses, too. You are able to remove them from Admin priviledges at anytime.</h3><br>
    <h3>As BUDGET WITH ME is still a fairly new app, we are adding new features for our users. Soon you will
    be able to pull reports and see where your money is going to by categories! Stay tuned for more details.</h3>
